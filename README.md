## Description of the group
Our goal is to work on projects that will help people immigrants, refugees,
and people who are being deported or are at risk of deportation.
Primarily, we want to be a resource for existing organizations that
are working on these issues.

If you have an idea for a project and want to chat about it with the group,
follow the instructions below under **projects** and then come by ChiHackNight
to tell us about it!

## Getting Started
We hang out in the #immigrationtaskforce channel of the
[chihacknight slack](https://chihacknight.slack.com/).
You can join the slack by visiting http://slackme.chihacknight.org/

Below is a list of projects in various projects. If you want to get involved with an active project, contact the project's owner! If you want to take ownership of a project that's proposed on on-hold, contact Yonatan (yonatan (at) yonatankogan.com or @yjkogan on slack).

## Projects
If you want to create a new project, do the following:

1. Create a GitHub account if you don't already have one: https://github.com/join

3. Set the title of your issue to the name of your project, and fill out the description template in the body. We will add the appropriate labels to it.

[Definitely up to date list is here](https://github.com/chi-immigration-task-force/getting-started/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aprojects%2Fproposed)

- Find datasets that would allow us to measure the likelihood of deportation based on whether or not you have an attorney. This was powerful data that convinced new york to provide free legal services for immigrants.([Link](https://github.com/chi-immigration-task-force/getting-started/issues/3))

[Definitely up to date list is here](https://github.com/chi-immigration-task-force/getting-started/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aprojects%2Fon-hold)
