## Description of the group
Our goal is to work on projects that will help people immigrants, refugees,
and people who are being deported or are at risk of deportation.
Primarily, we want to be a resource for existing organizations that
are working on these issues.

## Getting Started
We hang out in the #immigrationtaskforce channel of the
[chihacknight slack](https://chihacknight.slack.com/).

## Projects
### Active Projects
Definitely up to date list is here **TODO: Fill this in with a github issue search**

- Building an app for the [Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights](http://www.icirr.org/), focused first on finding resources and an "Emergency" button
- Some way for people to quickly understand what public benefits they're eligible for given their immigration status, focusing on what we can do to help support another ChiHackNight project/company, [mRelief](https://www.mrelief.com/).
- A "What can I do?" website that provides people with some suggested advocacy actions they can take, initially focused on immigration/refugee/deportation issues.

### Proposed Projects (need an owner)
Definitely up to date list is here **TODO: Fill this in with a github issue search**

- Building a website to provide information to people being deported about their rights and what resources are available to them
- Creating content to help people understand the deportation process. It seems like many of the things that come up from a basic google search are from unreliable or right-leaning sources. In particular building a site that is well SEO-ed.
- Find datasets that would allow us to measure the likelihood of deportation based on whether or not you have an attorney. This was powerful data that convinced new york to provide free legal services for immigrants
